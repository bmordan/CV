## Origin Story

**Feb 2019 - now WhiteHat**

Software Engineering Coach at WhiteHat. I have been designing and developing the curriculum for the level 4 software engineering apprenticeship. I am responsible for cohorts of 18 - 24 year olds undertaking a Level 4 apprenticeship. During the 18 month apprenticeship I deliver 3 months of tuition, set monthly assignments, review and coach apprentices to create a portfolio proving a set of technical competencies set by BCS (The Chartered Institute for IT). I conduct regular progress reviews with line managers and see apprentices through two exams.

**Feb 2018 - Feb 2019 Home Office** 

I was a Senior Node js developer in the Home Office. I Worked on an internal tool providing search capability and visualisation over a large dataset (2.5 billion nodes, 3 billion edges). As a full stack developer I extending the backend API (nodejs, elasticsearch, neo4j) with new functionality. I maintaining the frontend, porting an Angular 1.5 app to React. I delivered new features, repairing broken tests (added pre-commit hooks for tests, and test coverage reporting). I worked with Kubernetes and created a ETL (extract transform and load) pod that automated the ingestion of data into our datastores. Most interest task was taking the cypher queries and python code created by the data scientists on our team and rendering their algorithms in javascript ready for production.

**Autumn 2017 Freelance**

While waiting for security clearance to start work at the home office I created an online course [https://www.udemy.com/functional-programming-with-ramda](https://www.udemy.com/functional-programming-with-ramda/learn/v4/overview) introducing developers to functional programming concepts in javascript using the Ramda library. This is still earning me money today! I worked with the director of the Christian Muslim Forum to redesign and rebuild their website.

I joined [TABLEFLIP](https://tableflip.io) as a Junior Developer and working in a team of four developers delivering sites for startups, small businesses and individuals. All my code at TABLEFLIP was reviewed by the two senior developers who ran the company. I have been well schooled in good practice. We worked in an agile way with clients and I was responsible for working with them and organising our work with them into 5 day sprints.

I completed the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) 12 week course. I was introduced to test driven development, Ruby, Javascript, HTML5, worked with APIs and much more. In Makers Academy we paired everyday, worked in teams and had to complete weekend coding challenges. At the end of the course I was voted 'Person most likely to change the world' by my peers, something I was very proud of.
