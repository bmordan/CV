# Bernard Mordan
## Software Engineer
I love to write code. I cut my teeth as a junior with 2 superb Senior Node.js engineers. I picked up lots of new technologies at the Home Office and got some experience of running software at scale in the cloud (AWS). I have created and am maintaining 2 original software tools in my current role at Multiverse that are used daily by the other coaches. I love creating business impact with the software I make.

### Oct 2023 - now
Full stack software engineering at [Hertility Health](https://hertilityhealth.com). Developer dedicated to building Hertility's first mobile product.

### Feb 2019 - July 2023
Software Engineering Coach at [Multiverse](https://www.multiverse.io/en-GB/programmes/software-engineering). I have been designing and developing the curriculum for the level 4 software engineering apprenticeship from scratch. I am responsible for cohorts of 18 - 24 year olds undertaking a Level 4 apprenticeship. During the 18 month apprenticeship I deliver 3 months of tuition on full stack web development and all the stages of the software development lifecycle. I set monthly assignments, review and coach apprentices to create a portfolio proving evidence of a set of technical competencies set by [IFATE](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/software-developer-v1-1) (Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education). I conduct regular progress reviews with line managers and their apprentices at Facebook, Sky, Unilever and many more companies. I have also created internal software services to support the coaching community; 'Papper' the portfolio mapping tool, and 'The Observatory' a session observation and journaling platform.

### Feb 2018 - Feb 2019 Home Office 
I was a Senior Node.js developer in the Home Office. I worked in a mixed disciplined agile team on an internal tool providing search capability and visualisation over a massive dataset (2.5 billion nodes, 3 billion edges). As a full stack developer I extending the backend API (nodejs, elasticsearch, neo4j) with new functionality. I maintaining the frontend, porting an Angular 1.5 app to React. I delivered new features, repaired broken tests, added pre-commit hooks for tests, and test coverage reporting. I worked with Kubernetes and created a ETL (extract transform and load) pod that automated the ingestion of data into our datastores. The most interest task was taking the cypher queries and python code created by the data scientists on our team and rendering their algorithms in javascript ready for production into an AWS Kubernetes cluster. 

### Autumn 2017 Freelance
While waiting for security clearance to start work at the home office I created an online course [https://www.udemy.com/functional-programming-with-ramda](https://www.udemy.com/functional-programming-with-ramda/learn/v4/overview) introducing developers to functional programming concepts in javascript using the Ramda library. This is still earning me money today! I worked with the director of the Christian Muslim Forum to redesign and rebuild their website. [https://www.christianmuslimforum.org](https://christianmuslimforum.org). The Wordpress back-end is served to the Javascript frontend via a GraphQL endpoint.

### 2015 - 2017 TABLEFLIP
I joined [TABLEFLIP](https://tableflip.io) as a Junior Developer and working in a team of four developers delivering software projects for startups, small businesses and individuals. We ran alot of [Meteor](https://meteor.com) projects, and hosted the by-monthly Meteor meetups in London. All my code at TABLEFLIP was reviewed by the two senior developers who ran the company [Alan Shaw](https://github.com/alanshaw) and [Oli Evans](https://github.com/olizilla). I have been well schooled in good practice. We worked in an agile way with clients and I was responsible for working directly with them to organising their projects into 5 day sprints.

### Autumn 2014 Makers Academy
I completed the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) 12 week course. I was introduced to test driven development, Ruby, Javascript, HTML5, worked with APIs and much more. In Makers Academy we paired everyday, worked in teams and had to complete weekend coding challenges. At the end of the course I was voted 'Person most likely to change the world' by my peers, something I was very proud of.

Our final project at Makers Academy *(September 2014 cohort)*. A Meteor app for mobiles and the web. Here is a demo [video](https://youtu.be/qpGh8sWWuV0) here is the [repo](https://github.com/bmordan/flickynotes). I still think this is a really innovative piece of software.

#### 2008 - 2014 Evelina Children's Hospital School
I was the IT manager of Evelina Children's Hospital school in St Thomas Hospital, SE1. I looked after a small network of windows computers, ipads and laptops. Part of my role was to run computing workshops three times a week to sick children aged between 5 and 16. I was responsible for the school data and learnt SQL which helped to being great benefit and insight to the Headteacher. This is were my real interest in learning to programme was awoken. It was during quiet afternoons on reception that I started to teach myself to code.
