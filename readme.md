## tl;dr

I have 5 years of experience writing commercial software for the web. I lean toward a functional style of programming. My latest projects are written in Elm, and I am learning ReasonML you can checkout my origin story below.

## Origin Story

2018 - *

Now I am a javascript developer in the Home Office. Working on an internal tool providing search capability and visualization over a massive dataset (2.3 billion nodes, 2.7 billion edges). I have been working as full stack developer extending the backend API (nodejs, elasticsearch, neo4j) maintaining the frontend, porting an Angular 1.5 app to use redux in preparation for a rebuild in React. Taking the queries and python code of the data scientists on our team and rendering their algorithms in javascript ready for production.

2017 - 2018

While waiting for security clearance to start work at the home office I created an online course [https://www.udemy.com/functional-programming-with-ramda](https://www.udemy.com/functional-programming-with-ramda/learn/v4/overview) introducing developers to functional programming concepts in javascript using the Ramda library.

I worked with the director of the Christian Muslim Forum to redesign and rebuild their website. [http://christianmuslimforum.net](http://christianmuslimforum.net). This was a freelance project and I choose to build it in Elm. The site has a WordPress instance with a GraphQl serving it's content to an Elm frontend.  

2015 - 2017

I was the Junior Developer at [TABLEFLIP](https://tableflip.io) for 3 years working in a team of four delivering sites for startups, small businesses and individuals. All my code at TABLEFLIP was reviewed by the two senior developers who run the company, and I have been well schooled in good practice. We worked in an agile way with clients organising our work into 5 day sprints.
