##tl;dr

I have good ideas. I can work well in a team. I want to learn more. I graft.

##Computers and that

I have always loved computers. I was a slow reader, but when my parents bought me a Sinclair ZX Spectrum for my 7th Christmas, I started to read. I remember the light orange book entitled 'Basic Programming', I programatically drew geometric shapes, basic user auth and played lots of games!

At Dartington College of Arts when I was doing my Degree in Theatre and Arts Management (1995) one day, in the library, we were introduced to Adobe Photoshop, a scanner, and this thing called 'Netscape' through which one could access pages from the world wide web...

In Ireland (2001) I built a website for remote students studying our weekend class in Dublin. This was achieved over dialup, I made 45min audio recordings and managed to save them as 2MB files (using real player).

I supported my 2 years at Kagyu Samye Dzong with a series of freelance video projects built in Final Cut Express and Flash.

I started to writing code during my time in Evelina Children's hospital school. I learnt SQL and PHP with the Headteacher and the school business manager we worked to extend the way the school used it's data. I enjoyed it so much I wanted to learn to code for a living.

I was the IT manager of a small hospital school in central London. I looked after a small network of windows computers, taught computing three times a week to sick children aged between 5 and 16. It was during quiet afternoons on reception that I started to learn how to code.

2006 - 2008
I helped Lama Zangmo run Kagyu Samye Dzong London Tibetan Buddhist Center for 2 years.

2004 - 2006
I worked for Fusion Glass Designs in the kilnforming department. We made architectural glass and shipped it all over the world.
