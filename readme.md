## Bernard Mordan
**Software Engineer** 

## tl;dr

I have years of experience writing commercial software for the web. I lean toward a functional style of programming. I have a modern approach to writing javascript - don't write javascript. My latest projects are written in Elm, you can checkout my backstory below.

## Previous Experiences

2017 - *

Nodejs developer in the Home Office. Working on a internal tool providing search capability and visulisation over massive data (5.1 billion data points). I work as a full stack developer extending the backend API ,with test coverage, but mainly focused on the frontend, porting an Angular 1.5 app to use redux in preparation for a rebuild in React.

2016 - 2017

While waiting for security clearance to start work at the home office I created an online course [https://www.udemy.com/functional-programming-with-ramda](https://www.udemy.com/functional-programming-with-ramda/learn/v4/overview) introducing developers to functional programming concepts in javascript.

I worked with the director of the Christan Muslim Forum to redesign and rebuild their website in Elm. [http://christianmuslimforum.net](http://christianmuslimforum.net).

2015 - 2016

I was the Junior Developer at [TABLEFLIP](https://tableflip.io) working in a team of four delivering sites for start ups, small businesses and individuals. All my code at TABLEFLIP was reviewed by the two senior developers, and I have been well schooled in good practice. We worked in an agile way with clients organising our work into 5 day sprints.
