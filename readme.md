|Rock Paper Scissors was a weekend challange, a fun simple game with a little bit of logic on the backend. [Click here to Play the game online](http://lit-lake-3802.herokuapp.com/) the styling is targeted at phones so looks a bit daft on the desktop. [Click here to look at the code](https://github.com/bmordan/rock_paper_scissors)|Battleships was a week long group exercise. This was my first experience of working on a code base in a team of four. I would highlight one part of the code that I wrote with Victoria to place battle ships on a board before a game.

##tl;dr

I have good ideas. I can work well in a team. I want to learn more. I am a craftsman.

##Computers and that

I have always loved computers. I was a slow reader, but when my parents bought me a Sinclair ZX Spectrum for my 7th Christmas, I started to read. I remember the light orange book entitled 'Basic Programming', I programmed geometric shapes, basic user auth and played lots of games!

At Dartington in the higher close library we were introduced to a scanner! and this thing called 'Netscape' through which one could access pages from the world wide web...

In Ireland I built a website that served 5 remote students studying our weekend class in Dublin. This was all over dialup, I made 45min audio recordings and managed to save them as 2MB files (using real player).

I supported my 2 years at Kagyu Samye Dzong with a series of freelance video projects built in Final Cut Express and Flash.

##My Past
